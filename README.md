This **E-Learning Platform Analysis Project** is a comprehensive data-driven solution that provides detailed insights into user engagement, feedback, course popularity, and platform usage using Python and SQLite. It mimics a real-world education analytics pipeline that can be used by ed-tech platforms or academic institutions to evaluate user activity, identify top-performing courses, and generate automated PDF reports for stakeholders.

Built using Python and core data libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `FPDF`, the project integrates SQL-based data extraction, modular scripts for analytics, and auto-generated visual reports — all optimized for clarity and reproducibility. The SQLite database (`e_learning.db`) holds structured user interaction data such as enrollments, feedback, watch history, and course info.

It features robust automation that:
- Executes SQL queries to extract insights
- Generates bar plots and charts of course/user engagement
- Converts metrics into downloadable PDF reports

This project showcases the power of **data analytics + reporting** in ed-tech, providing real-time actionable feedback for platform optimization and decision-making.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Designing modular and reusable Python scripts for analytics and reporting.
- Structuring and querying relational data efficiently in SQLite.
- Automating multi-step processes like DB connection, querying, charting, and PDF generation.
- Managing compatibility between Python, SQLite drivers, and FPDF.
- Handling cases of missing feedback, zero-enrollment users, and course duplication.

---

## ⚖️ Data Considerations

- Dataset includes platform activity simulations: users, enrollments, feedback, and watch history.
- All tables are joined using appropriate keys and filtered to ensure data consistency.
- Feedback normalization and enrollment merging were handled during analysis to ensure accurate KPIs.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time interactive insights.
- Integrate advanced SQL views and stored procedures.
- Implement admin-level analytics and alerts for underperforming courses.
- Add authentication and file storage for user-specific PDF access.
- Connect to a cloud database (PostgreSQL/Azure SQL) for deployment-ready version.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zufran123/e-learning-platform-analysis.git
cd e-learning-platform-analysis
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📂 Database Schema

The SQLite database `e_learning.db` contains:

- `users` — Basic user info  
- `courses` — Course catalog  
- `enrollments` — Enrolled users per course  
- `feedback` — Course-wise ratings and reviews  
- `watch_history` — User activity timestamps  

> You can modify or extend the schema using the `src/connect_db.py` file and corresponding `.sql` files if needed.

---

## 📈 Future Add-ons
